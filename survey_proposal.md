State of User Privacy

User information like credentials, preferences and other details shared online have shaped prominent techs like social media, advertisement and marketing tools, recommendation systems, etc. Because this same information of a user is valuable to a large number of use cases, it's no surprise that this value has given rise to a market where personal data is collectively aggregated, refined and sold. For example, the use of third party cookies to collect and share user data across sites, use of targeted ads to shape user behavior and shady ways to uniquely identify (fingerprint) a user despite not sharing any personal details deliberately have led to a much reduced user trust in these systems. Because of how deeply ingrained these methods are, getting rid of them would lead to an incovenient user experience or the need for a different economic model altogether. Fortunately, recent advances in cryptography and increasing demands from the general public have made it possible to design and implement systems focused on maintaining user privacy. For example, 

- browser telemetry systems collect and operate on aggregated user data to extract relevant metrics all the while ensuring user privacy, 
- ENPA notifies user of potential exposure to COVID without accessing individual user details,
- Google Privacy Sandbox is working on technologies like Topics API, Fledge, Reporting API which will replace use of third party cookies,
- advances in zero knowledge proofs make it possible to prove a statement while hiding private details, 
- multi-party computation ensures no single data handling server has autonomous access to user data and so on. 

It is safe to assume that these privacy friendly techs will find more applications in near future, starting with those where the demand for privacy is relatively higher.


Representing User Info

Notion of privacy differs between people; what one may be reluctant to share could be something others won't hesitate to do. Besides ways in which user data is being used (or misused) is not public knowledge, so a user can only estimate something as requiring privacy based on his limited understanding of how that piece of information being public could harm him.
