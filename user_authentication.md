too broad a topic ?
by authenticating you're proving something

authentic identity, attribute (membership)
proof of knowledge
zero knowledge proof for secrecy, using mixers and proxies, Elgamal encryption, sigma proofs
proof of membership, ownership
verification procedure

token gating with NFTs
TokenScript and BrandConnector
web2 authenticator for web3

implications of choosing what to prove
complexity
how well does it scale
authenticate that which draws value 

redo authentication
federated identity, transferrable identity
enclave as backup https://signal.org/blog/secure-value-recovery/
applications that authenticate: wallets, tokens inside
